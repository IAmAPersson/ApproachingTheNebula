# ApproachingTheNebula
This is a [project](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/universe-beauty-and-wonder/shoulders-giants/teams/nebula/project) done by Team Nebula during the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2018](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/) in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. 
The challenge this project addresses is the [On the Shoulders of Giants project](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/universe-beauty-and-wonder/shoulders-giants/details). 
Approaching the Nebula is a platform game where the player must travel with humanity over to the Orion Nebula, where a new star is forming.
Why? Because our current star, the Sun, is expanding into its Red Giant phase and will soon eat Earth as it expands.

## Why?
Approaching The Nebula tries to bring awareness to the Hubble Space Telescope by using images from the Telescope as the background image 
and as the platforms that the player must avoid. This game also brings awareness to special relativity through time dilation playing an
important part in the game's mechanics.

## Story
Ever since its launch in 1990, the Hubble telescope urges mankind to dream big. The astounding images captured by Hubble bring light 
and understanding to space objects lightyears away. Despite our growing need for advancement, in 2018 2.4 million stem jobs will go 
unfilled. To further human exploration, our younger generation may need to be engaged in a different way. By using images of the Hubble 
telescope and a video game mechanic, doing so becomes easy. The game Approaching the Nebula highlights the extreme distance between earth 
and these beautiful images by using them as colliding game objects. Players must maneuver around stars and nebulae to reach their 
final destination: the Orion Nebula, one of the closest star factories to earth, only 1,344 light years away. Approaching the nebula is 
set in a far future where travel to the Orion Nebula is both possible and necessary. The worlds population has built a Dyson sphere around 
the Sun consisting of solar panels to harness its energy. Due to the Sun's eventual expansion as it becomes a red giant, a new star 
is needed to power the sphere. To capture a new young star, journey to the Orion Nebula by pulling the Dyson sphere in a spacecraft 
loosely modeled after the Orion spacecraft. To increase the games difficulty, a time constraint is added using time dilation to 
both restrict players and to provide interest in advanced physics, such as relativity. The journey must be made in 3 days or else the 
temperature of the Dyson sphere will drop below habitable temperatures. You are the pilot and will either save the future of humanity or 
doom us all. Good luck.
