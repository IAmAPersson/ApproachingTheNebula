# ApproachingTheNebula
This is a project done by Team Nebula during the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2018](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/) in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. 
The challenge this project addresses is the [On the Shoulders of Giants project](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/universe-beauty-and-wonder/shoulders-giants/details). 
Approaching the Nebula is a platform game where the player must travel with humanity over to the Carina Nebula, where a new star is forming.
Why? Because our current star, the Sun, is expanding into its Red Dwarf phase and will soon eat Earth as it expands.

## Why?
Approaching The Nebula tries to bring awareness to the Hubble Space Telescope by using images from the Telescope as the background image 
and as the platforms that the player must avoid. This game also brings awareness to special relativity through time dilation playing an
important part in the game's mechanics.
